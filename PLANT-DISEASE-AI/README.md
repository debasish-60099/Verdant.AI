# 🌿 AI Leaf Disease Detection System

This project is an AI-powered web application designed to detect leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. The system is trained on **53,000+ images** and is currently capable of predicting plant leaf diseases through a simple and intuitive web interface.



## ✅ Current Features

- 🧠 **AI Model Trained**: A custom-trained model using 53,000 leaf images.
- 🖥️ **Web Interface**: Built using **Flask**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
- 📁 **Local Deployment**: Easily testable on any local machine.



## 🛠 How to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to run the app on your own system:

```bash
# Step 1: Remove paste.txt files and paste the ai/ml dataset that i send in the wp group in the model portions

# Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install flask tensorflow numpy

# Step 3: Start the Flask application
python app.py
```


## 📋 Upcoming Features & TODOs

We are still working on several exciting enhancements:

### 📸 Camera Integration
Allow users to **capture live leaf images** directly through their device camera.

### 🧪 Auto-Scroll & Report View
Clicking the **Analyze** button will **auto-scroll** to the **disease prediction report** section.

### 🔊 Voice Assistant
Add **text-to-speech functionality** to **read out the analysis report** for visually impaired or multitasking users.

### 📄 PDF Download
Currently, reports download in `.txt` format. We'll enable **PDF report downloads** for better presentation and documentation.

### 📱 Tailwind CSS Enhancement
Revamp the **navbar** and **footer** using **Tailwind CSS** for **better mobile responsiveness**.

### ⚛️ React Integration
Convert the complete app into a **React-based frontend** using **Gen AI and automation tools**.

### 🛒 Product Ordering System
Add a **product order feature** with backend support, similar to an **e-commerce system** for buying fertilizers, tools, etc.

### 🤖 Smart Product Suggestions
Integrate **product recommendation suggestions** using **JSON-based configuration or AI logic** based on detected disease or plant type.
