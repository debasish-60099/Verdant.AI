## 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Module

Our **Weather Forecasting** section is now successfully developed and integrated into the application. It includes features like hourly forecasts, dynamic UI panels, and a responsive design.

## 🛠️ Front-End Developer Fixes & Enhancements

The front-end developer has made the following UI/UX improvements to enhance the responsiveness, design consistency, and usability of the application:

### 📌 Navigation Panel Notifications
- Fixed the layout and functionality of the notification buttons in the navigation panel for better alignment and interaction.

### 🔍 Search Box Behavior
- Improved the search input behavior by removing the unwanted green border that appeared when text was entered.

### ⏱️ Hourly Forecasting Panel
- Ensured that the six div panels used for hourly forecasting are properly center-aligned for a cleaner and more symmetric display.

### 🎨 Responsive Background Design
- Applied a consistent and responsive background design across all pages and features.
- Implemented a cohesive color gradient to maintain visual uniformity and enhance aesthetics across the interface.


### ⚙️ How to Run the Project (Frontend)

To set up and run the front-end locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Install all dependencies
